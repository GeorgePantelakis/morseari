# morseari

# This is a personal project.

Morseari was created to encode and decode messages using some of the worlds best physical encoding algorithms like the morse code. This program doesn't encrypt the message it just encodes it. The program was designed to be plug-and-play and to take new encryptions without tempering the code. This program served me well in several occations.
